For "host" model that's probably not the end of the world. Apps have
already given up strong guarantee of migration compat by using 'host'
CPU and so in that context libvirt's feature comparison can assume
the underlying silicon is a match and just compare features.


In that sense the ability to list features and baseline two cpus
lets you guarantee that whatever CPU you boot the guest on, will
have at least those requested features. That's useful, even if it
does not give you a strong migration compat guarantee.

Doing better would require info on non-writable features, and
possibly even that might not be sufficient to guarantee compat

With regards,
Daniel
