I was more thinking of dependencies on the KVM version -- QEMU versions
are easier to control for, but you don't really know what kernel version
you are running with. In the end, we'd probably need to mark a lot of
things as unmigratable.

My concern was more about code complexity, not hw complexity. We'll
probably end up with a zoo of weird creatures for Arm, but I don't see a
reason why the code would need to have strange things tacked
on. I.e. have a set of arch extensions that you can baseline to, and
have individual cpus on top, so you can deal with both well-known cpus
and more boutique ones.

We have a list of features that are optional for a given arch extension,
and a list of features that are mandatory, so I think we'd be able to
generate a model with the mandatory features only. Models for individual
cpus could base off these. (There are currently 13 vendors defined in
MIDR, but I'm not sure how often new vendors might be added, and vendors
may also be more or less active.) If you have a baseline of Arm v9.2 or
so, that might already go a long way.

[But I obviously have no idea how well that will work when it meats
reality :)]
