Following up on this, some ideas/questions on how a command line could
look like and behave.

Let's say we introduce Armv80, Armv81, ... models for the architecture
extensions and optionally named models for individual cpus we care about
(e.g. My85BasedCpu which would be Armv85 + some stuff on top). The
Armv<xy> models would come with all mandatory features turned on and
would allow all optional features to be set or unset, with
(accelerator-specific) verification on top.

Let's assume that we have

-cpu Armv80,FEAT_AdvSIMD=3Don,FEAT_FP=3Don

Since the two features provide each other, I'd assume

-cpu Armv80,FEAT_AdvSIMD=3Don

or

-cpu Armv80,FEAT_FP=3Don

to be equivalent, and

-cpu Armv80,FEAT_AdvSIMD=3Don,FEAT_FP=3Doff

to generate an error. Question: at which level? s390x does dependency
validation in QEMU, we could do it as well, but I think we have way more
dependencies on Arm.

Also, let's take FEAT_BTI, which is optional for 8.4 and mandatory from
8.5 onwards. I'd expect

-cpu Armv84,FEAT_BTI=3Don   <-- ok
-cpu Armv84  same as -cpu Armv84,FEAT_BTI=3Doff
-cpu Armv85 same as -cpu Arm84,FEAT_BTI=3Don
-cpu Armv85,FEAT_BTI=3Doff  <-- Error!

When doing baselining while looking at id registers, we'd get

ID_AA64PFR1_EL1.BT =3D=3D 1 -> must use Armv84 or later
ID_AA64PFR1_EL1.BT =3D=3D 0 -> must use Armv84 or earlier

(unfortunately, some other features are more complex...)

Would

-cpu Armv84,<all 8.5 mandatory bits>

generate the same cpu as

-cpu Armv85

(and therefore, the two be migratable between each other?)

If we create named cpu models for individual cpus, e.g.

-cpu My85BasedCpu

as equivalent to

-cpu Armv85,FEAT_FOO=3Don,FEAT_BAR=3Don

Should we allow

-cpu My85BasedCpu,FEAT_BAR=3Doff

or would the command line need to be

-cpu Armv85,FEAT_FOO=3Don

(e.g. to deal with not all id regs being writable?)

Regardless of what we end up doing for features and cpu models, we'll
need to be able to specify registers that do not correlate to any
features; especially for things like MIDR/REVIDR, where we'll want to
provide a list of possible target values as pairs;

-cpu Armv85,midr_revidr=3D(<value>,<value>)

is ugly, and figuring the actual values is not user friendly at all, I
fear :(

And now, at the end of this long email, the most important questions:
What colour should the features have?

Matching the architecture: FEAT_AdvSIMD, FEAT_FP, FEAT_BTI

Dropping "FEAT_": AdvSIMD, FP, BTI

Less shouty: feat_advsimd, feat_fp, feat_bti

Less shouty and shorter: advsimd, fp, bti  -- in this case we'd need to
be careful because we already have sve/sme props, and I'm not sure if we
could do some sugaring without conflicts.

Thoughts?
