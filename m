There's plenty of wierd history in x86 too. In this
case I might suggest just picking one of the two
common names, and ignoring the other.

If we really wanted to, we could alias the 2nd name
to the first, but its likely not worth the bother.

AFAICT, in x86 world, there's no generally documented dependancies
between features. I imagine there might be deps mentioned in an
adhoc basis in docs/specs.  There are certainly implicit deps though
where apps check for X, and blindly assume it means Y+Z also exist.

In the QEMU  & libvirt world though, there's no deps. This is generally
why we discourage apps/users from trying to enable arbitrarily many
features. People should stick to the named CPU models, and just use
feature enablement as an exception.

Enabling individual features *is* certainly a critically important
benefit though, even with the risks from implicit undocumented
dependencies.

Most notably, it has been used to turn on fixes for hardware CVEs,
where microcode introduces a new named feature. Your named CPU
model may not be updated, but as long as QEMU knows the feature
name, you can turn it on.

Overall, while it would be desirable to have a way to express
feature dependencies, I wouldn't call that a blocker for enabling
the ability to turn features on & off.

With regards,
Daniel
