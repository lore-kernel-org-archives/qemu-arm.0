The thought was we'd synchronize occasionally as needed. If somebody
adds new gic tests that require new defines, then they'd just synch
everything. I agree it's less than ideal to try and maintain duplicate
copies of stuff though.

This is certainly a bigger concern. Duplicating blindly would indeed
just copy bugs. OTOH, I found a couple of bitmask bugs in the kernel
precisely because I was reviewing them while duplicating. I think I
agree with you though that we should be extra cautious with macros,
and even have the spec open to confirm register offsets aren't wrong
while copying.

I agree the Linux defaults should not be the only inputs kvm-unit-tests
uses. That was never the plan. In this series I've introduced
gicv[23]_enable_defaults, which do indeed mimic Linux (but with much
simplification). They serve two purposes, 1) I can confirm the framework
works as least as well as Linux in order to provide a solid base for
new tests and 2) unit tests that need a gic, but don't plan to test it
specifically, and thus don't care much about how it's enabled, can use
these enable functions just to get a functioning one. However, gic unit
test writers (like you :-) should only use gic_init(), which does nothing
other than probe DT for the base addresses.

It's a similar idea to what we were going to do - synchronizing as we
go, but instead of seeding the file with everything Linux has today we
only seed it with what we use today. If, however, somebody writes the
test Christoffer and you both proposed independently, which is to write
all registers and then read them all back to make sure they have the
expected values after considering their behaviors, then we'll be
importing nearly all register defines at once anyway. That said, we
haven't written that test yet, so I can live with this initial series
only taking what it needs.

Yes please. I'll take your advise on this and post with minimal defines
for now. Do you have patches that apply to my branch? If so, I'll
integrate them for the v4 posting.

We can drop these erratas for now, and then add them as necessary. I
wouldn't want kvm-unit-tests to discriminate hardware though.

Thanks for looking at this!
