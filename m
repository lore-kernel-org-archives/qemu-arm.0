I am fine with either of them (grep vs. same names), just not both at
the same time ;-)
So it's your call at the end, but I lean more toward modern names.
And yes, I can deal with both naming schemes when debugging ;-)

Ah, TCG might be different, because it also aims at emulating EL2 & 3,
AFAIK. So the implementation in there is probably including the secure
side as well (haven't checked, though).

Thanks!
