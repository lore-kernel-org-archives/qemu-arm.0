Some analysis of FEAT_xxx mappings:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87ikstn8sc.fsf@redhat.com/

(actually, ~190 of FEAT_xxx map to a single value in a single register,
so mappings are easy other than the sheer amount of them)

We probably should simply not support FEAT_xxx that are solely defined
via dependencies.

Some more real-world examples from some cpu pairings I had looked at:
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/87ldx2krdp.fsf@redhat.com/
(but also see Peter's follow-up, the endianness field is actually
covered by a feature)

The values-in-registers-not-covered-by-features we are currently aware
of are:
- number of breakpoints
- PARange values
- GIC
- some fields in CTR_EL0
(see also
https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/4fb49b5b02bb417399ee871b2c85bb35@huawei.=
com/
for the latter two)

Also, MIDR/REVIDR handling.

Given that we'll need a mix if we support FEAT_xxx, should we mandate
the FEAT_xxx syntax if there is a mapping and allow direct specification
of register fields only if there is none, or allow them as alternatives
(with proper priority handling, or alias handling?)

For these, we'll already need the mix (my examples above all came from
these use cases.)

(Of course, the existing legacy props need to be expressed as well. I
guess they should map to registers directly.)

I'd focus on the actually needed features first, as otherwise it's
really overwhelming.

Using e.g. Neoverse-V2 as a base currently looks most attractive to
me -- going with Armv<x>.<y> would probably give a larger diff (although
the diff for Graviton3/4 is pretty large anyway.)
