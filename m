Subject: [PATCH 06/18] qemu-options: finesse the recommendations around -blockdev

We are a bit premature in recommending -blockdev/-device as the best
way to configure block devices. It seems there are times the more
human friendly -drive still makes sense especially when -snapshot is
involved.

Improve the language to hopefully make things clearer.
