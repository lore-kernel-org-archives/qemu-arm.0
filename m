Whereever they are referencing 'host', the docs should also
mention 'max' CPU which should be a drop-in functional
equivalent.

On x86,   "-cpu help" will list all feature names too. It makes the
output pretty huge, so not sure if we want to mirror that on arm ?
It is at least more useful to humans though, compared to QMP.
