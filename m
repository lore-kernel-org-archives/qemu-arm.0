Hi Peter,

Given the examples should look exactly like those for x86/pc, do we need
extra examples in cxl.rst? I guess I can add one simple arm/virt example
in a follow up patch without bloating that file too badly..

Is the following sufficient for the board specific docs?

It doesn't move any existing stuff because these are naturally aligned
regions so this is in a gap before the PCIE ECAM region.

Chunk of /proc/iomem with a random test case (in first case with the cxl bi=

removed as obvious that doesn't start until this patch is in place).
Need more than 123 cpus to make the second gicv3 redist appear
(I've no idea why that number I just printed the threshold where
it was calculated to find out what I needed to wait for boot on).

The extra ECAM is the PXB stuff kicking in and stealing part of the ECAM
region of the main host bridge.

The CXL bit we care about here is port1. Despite the name which is
an artifact of how linux represents the topology, that is
the registers for the CXL PXB root bridge.

cxl_devices_state state is really just grouping the CXL host stuff that
every cxl host needs so this perhaps looks like more than it actually is.
Maybe that needs a rename. It does less than used to after patch 2 took
some of the Fixed memory stuff out of there.

typedef struct CXLState {
    bool is_enabled;
    MemoryRegion host_mr;
    unsigned int next_mr_idx;
    CXLFixedMemoryWindowOptionsList *cfmw_list;
} CXLState;

It has two purposes.  The cfmw_list and is_enabled are so that
we can use cxl_host_init() to unify setting up the CXL specific machine
properties.

host_mr and next_mr_idx are for a very simple fixed chunk address space
allocator for the PXB-CXL base registers. This is a little bit nasty but
it allows the PXBs to be initialized with -device and yet have mmio
address ranges. Bit similar to the runtime instantiation of SMMUs
problem Shameer was running into, but a simpler one.  I couldn't
find a way to use sysbus or similar here because we also need this
PXB device to exist on the main PCI bus like any other PCI expander bridge
- it just needs these extra registers in the main memory map that are then
pointed to by ACPI table entries. These are what is known as RCRB in PCI
terms (Root complex register base).

See implementation of pxb_cxl_hook_up_registers() call in
virt_machine_done() that stitches this together once we know what
pxb-cxl devices are present and maps sub regions into this container.

I'd be happy to have suggestions on how to do this better as I've never
been fond of this bit.

One option might be to just make this more explicit by putting host_mr and
next_mr_idx directly in the virt machine state and passing them
as separate parameters to pxb_cxl_hook_up_registers(). I'm not sure
that gains much though.  Another path would be to wrap the region init
and add subregion up in a helper function called from here and i386/pc.c
That would mean the name at least was explicitly shared. Not sure it would
bring much other benefit.

I'll admit the way that these address maps are calculated has caused
me several headaches.  The intention was to go above everything so as to
avoid any changes to the existing map.

I think highest_gpa is a running value of how high we have allocated
to something, not a maximum that is supported.  E.g. what is going on
in virt_set_high_memmap()

I guess I should update vms->highest_gpa.  I think nothing uses it after th=
is
but they might in future.

+    vms->highest_gpa =3D cxl_fmws_set_memmap(ROUND_UP(vms->highest_gpa + 1=
, 256 * MiB),
+                                           BIT_ULL(pa_bits)) - 1;

should update it correctly. In i386/pc.c we already updated the memory map =
top address
tracking so that function already returns the start of the next region (hen=
ce the - 1
is needed - that is similar to the call for virt_set_high_memmap() a few li=
nes up.

I think that will also result in more elegant failure on CPUs with limited
address space than we had before as that is checked in virt_cpu_post_init()

Using an a55 for instance fails (Fujitsu folk ran into this a while back)
as we need more than 40 bits.

Just for reference here's the relevant bit of /proc/iomem
for a test setup intended to poke some of these corners.

8000000000-80000fffff : PCI Bus 0000:00

      10000000000-1000fffffff : System RAM (kmem)

So the windows sits above the PCI region.
