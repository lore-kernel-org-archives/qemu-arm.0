drivers/irqchip/irq-gic-common.c:gic_cpu_config uses it, along with
GICD_INT_DEF_PRI_X4 and GIC_DIST_PRI. But I guess those are the only
shared ones duplicated here so far, so I was wrong to say the two
below were the only two not shared.

Yeah, I noticed that too, craziness. OK, I won't fight for the
greppability argument too hard. Actually, you'll likely be the
one doing the grepping when you go fix the driver :-) If you'd
prefer we only use one set of defines (the better, modern ones),
then for v5 that's what I'll do.

At least with TCG, yes. When I removed it and quick tested on my x86
notebook the gic test hung. I didn't try to debug, I just added stuff
until it worked...

As I need GICR_IGROUP0, I'll bring GICD_IGROUPRn back too.
